# HiramAbiff: Chain-Agnostic DeFi Agent

HiramAbiff is an autonomous AI agent that analyzes DeFi opportunities across multiple blockchains with a focus on Solana. Built entirely on open source technology, it collects data, executes trades, provides reports, and continually improves itself through ML algorithms and agent collaboration, all while maintaining the highest security standards.

## Vision

A secure, self-evolving DeFi agent that maximizes returns by leveraging Solana's speed and low fees while maintaining visibility across the entire crypto landscape with enterprise-grade security, built on a foundation of open source technologies.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Data Aggregation**: DeFiLlama integration, cross-chain analytics, protocol discovery
- **Advanced Trading Capabilities**: Automated execution, optimal routing, cross-chain bridging
- **Machine Learning & Analysis**: Yield prediction, risk assessment, portfolio optimization
- **Autonomous Operation**: Self-maintenance, error recovery, 24/7 operation
- **Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agent network for research, trading, and risk assessment
- **Self-Improvement**: Performance analysis, model retraining, strategy evolution
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Threat detection, multi-sig wallets, contingency plans

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Rust (for Solana program development)
- Node.js 18+ (for Web3.js integration)
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HiramAbiff.git
   cd HiramAbiff
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your API keys and configuration
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

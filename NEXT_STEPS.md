# HiramAbiff Project: Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a well-organized project structure with dedicated directories for source code, examples, tests, documentation, and tools
   - Set up standard project files like README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, etc.
   - Prepared Docker setup for containerized deployment

2. **Core Framework**
   - Implemented the base agent architecture in `src/agents/base_agent.py`
   - Created a DeFi agent in `src/agents/defi_agent.py` for analyzing yield opportunities
   - Built a wallet management system in `src/blockchain/wallet.py`
   - Set up logging and configuration systems in `src/core/`

3. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Created a Solana client in `src/blockchain/solana_client.py`
   - Implemented example scripts for interacting with Solana testnet
   - Successfully tested basic connectivity with the Solana testnet

4. **Examples**
   - Created multiple examples ranging from simple to advanced:
     - `simple_solana_test.py` for basic Solana connectivity
     - `solana_testnet_example.py` for demonstrating Solana functionality
     - `minimal_defi_agent.py` for showing agent functionality without external dependencies
     - More advanced examples for complete DeFi agent usage

5. **Utilities**
   - Created a dependency checker in `tools/check_dependencies.py`
   - Added comprehensive documentation in README files across the project

6. **Command-Line Interface**
   - Implemented a basic CLI in `src/hiramabiff/cli.py`
   - Added a `yield` command to find yield opportunities
   - Created detailed documentation in `README_CLI.md`
   - Added entry points in `setup.py` for CLI tools

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete the Core Agent Framework

- [ ] Implement a proper task queue system for the agents
- [ ] Add persistence layer for saving agent state and results
- [ ] Create a standardized communication protocol between agents
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for agent API

### 2. Enhance Blockchain Integration

- [ ] Complete the Solana integration with proper transaction building and signing
- [ ] Add support for additional blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- [ ] Implement cross-chain communication capabilities
- [ ] Create proper error handling and retry mechanism for blockchain operations

### 3. Build Advanced DeFi Capabilities

- [ ] Integrate with live DeFi protocols for real yield data
- [ ] Implement arbitrage detection algorithms
- [ ] Create liquidity analysis tools
- [ ] Add risk assessment capabilities

### 4. Improve Developer Experience

- [ ] Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Complete the test suite with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Improve the documentation with more examples and API references
- [ ] Create interactive tutorials for getting started
- [ ] Enhance the CLI with more commands and features:
  - [ ] Add wallet management commands
  - [ ] Implement transaction commands for interacting with DeFi protocols
  - [ ] Add configuration management commands
  - [ ] Create interactive modes for complex operations
  - [ ] Add visualization options (charts, graphs) for yield data

### 5. Immediate Tasks (Based on Dependency Check)

- [ ] Install missing Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy scipy sqlalchemy alembic psycopg2-binary redis web3 solana anchorpy eth-brownie scikit-learn tensorflow pytest loguru
  ```

- [ ] Set up required environment variables in .env file:
  ```
  SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
  SOLANA_RPC_URL_TESTNET=https://api.testnet.solana.com
  SOLANA_RPC_URL_DEVNET=https://api.devnet.solana.com
  LOG_LEVEL=INFO
  LOG_FILE=hiram.log
  ```

- [ ] Install the HiramAbiff package in development mode:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

### 6. Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Create a web-based dashboard for monitoring agents
- [ ] Implement a notification system for important events
- [ ] Add support for AI-assisted strategy generation
- [ ] Develop a plugin system for extending agent capabilities
